          In the near future, WA's next step is to grow into a closer-knit mutual support community. We hope to achieve this by working closely with local small vendors, restaurants, service providers, and building stronger connections through collaboration. Guided by this vision, we aim to:

            <p class="text-gray-600">
              WA invites small businesses in Chinatown to include their services in the community service directory. Workers and community members can access these services while also benefiting from services offered by other participating businesses, creating a mutually supportive community ecosystem.

            <p class="text-gray-600">
              As more businesses and community members join, the service directory grows to cover a wider range of daily life and work scenarios, providing comprehensive and diverse support and opportunities for all participants.
